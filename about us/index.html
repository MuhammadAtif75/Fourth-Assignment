        <p>Over the period of the last 11 years, you have taken Bright Tech from a simple business idea to a revolution
            in the heart of Pakistan’s Information Technology market. The idea behind the development of Bright Tech was
            never about creating a retailer with good prices; but to give birth to a place where people could be served
            as a part of the family. Where they could actually feel the touch of Information Technology’s application in
            the way they are dealt with. The world has moved to the next generation of business relationships; and we
            are proud to be the first in Pakistan’s Information Technology market to accept that “Yes, YOU are
            important!” With around 1,000% growth rate, we are proud and extremely happy to quote that Bright Tech has a
            family of approximately 40,000 (and growing) online family members and more than 60,000 (and growing)
            customer’s offline; in comparison to a total of 10 customers 11 years ago. The world is changing and Bright
            Tech happily accepts that the customers of today are more tech savvy and demand value for their money. We
            believe that change is the only thing constant and in order to deliver to you the value you deserve, we are
            always in the process of evolving to the next best level.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content1">
        <p>The success of Bright Tech is not a magical coincidence but a result of experienced professionals listening
            to and implementing every suggestion that YOU gifted us with over the past 11 years. The world has
            revolutionized and it’s time to move from those close gullied and air tight markets to a system of
            automation where you do not need to run after sales people asking for product specification and quotations.
            Have a nice sip of coffee, stretch your legs and go through the updated, complete and vast range of products
            awaiting your royal presence by a few clicks. Even if you are not comfortable at dealing with an online
            market and need a more personal touch and suggestion to things; come visit Bright Tech. 11 years ago people
            didn’t have online markets; and Bright Tech respects your demand for one to one communication and anxiously
            awaits your presence.</p>

    <div class="content2">
        <p>There might still be a lot of things that you could want to know about Bright Tech. Simply Sign up, feel
            free, and don’t be shy. We never tell our customers to hush away because there are others to deal with or we
            already met our daily sales quota. So, welcome to Bright Tech; and don’t you worry because whether you are a
            corporate client or an individual customer; we are family now. Welcome to the Information Technology’s
            Revolution in Pakistan!</p>
